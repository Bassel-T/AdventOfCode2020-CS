# AdventOfCode2020-CS

The "Advent Of Code" is a 25-day challenge for programmers starting on December 1st every year. This challenge is comprised of problems that can be easily solvable by hand, though they would take too long. Hence, programmers are incentivised to code something to provide the answer. This repository contains my solutions in C#.

All code that you see in this project is my own. I have received no help from other people. Any resemblance to existing code is coincidental.
